                                            <h5>Artifical intelligence is the growing field of knowledge, as demonstrated by machines. Through learning, robots can provide reasons, data, and solutions to any type of simulated routine. To do so, these machines demonstrate humanlike cognitive functions such as problem solving and planning. Ever since its early stages in the 1950s, artificial intelligence has reached new heights, for example, artificial intelligence and machine learning enabled astronomers to discover and identify a distant eight-planet solar system. With the industry gaining a resurgence in the recent advances in computational power and theoretical understanding, AI has become essential to multiple technology industries, thousands of businesses, and millions of people all over the world.</h5>
